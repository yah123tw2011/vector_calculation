# vector_calculation
A Vector Calculation Program by applying operator overloading (C++)

/* Sample input
N a 3 0 0 0
N b 5 1 2 1 2 5
A a 8 3 4 3 4 3 4 5 6
N c 2 -1 -2
S 4 a a b c
I a 1 0
C L a b
*/

/* Sample Output
0
*/

/*
 N: (new vector) creates a new vector "a", with value "3 0 0 0"
 A: (assignment) assigns "8 3 4 3 4 3 4 5 6" to vector a
 S: (sum) adds vector "a", "b", and "c" to "a"
 I: (indexing) assign "0" to a[1]
 C: (compare) L for Less, G for Greater, E for Equal. Returns bool.
